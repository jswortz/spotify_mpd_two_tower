    "\n",
    "Semantic matching requires pairs, triplets (tuples generally) of co-occurrences between pairs. This is a very broad definition, and with this newer approach many new use cases are being explored. A simple example are finding pairs of user queries and purchases. The training example pair are: (the features we know from the user query, the features we know on the product they ultimately purchased).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other approaches where triples are considered, and there are advanced techniques on negative sampling, finding “bad” examples of query, product pairs, which we will not cover here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note there are other sampling techniques we highlight below (different artist/album)\n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen task was predicting the next song on a playlist, given the playlist existing order. The approach taken was to create pairs for all children songs and their parent playlists. We did leveraging BigQuery’s `UNNEST` and `CROSS JOIN`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also had rich features for playlists, albums and songs in another table that was later used to enrich post `CROSS JOIN`. This was done to optimize the computation since the cross-joining is expensive and it was subsequently much quicker to enrich after this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we completed this step, we had all combinations of child song, playlist pairs. The song was the candidate label but the playlist still contained the candidate label and all songs after. Additional criteria was added to remove the candidate song and all songs that occur after the candidate in the playlist. For the sake of performance we also only considered the last 5 played songs. Other sampling configurations are available in the example notebook as well (only predicting when there are album and artist switches).\n",
    "\n",
    "What this results in is a training dataset that has all possible child song candidates joined with the full playlist data, and the playlist data is properly censored as to only contain songs up to before the candidate song.\n",
